Hi! I'm Jeonghyeon Na. I am a research intern at Visual Computing Lab at SNU, advised by [Prof. Hanbyul Joo](https://jhugestar.github.io/). I received B.S. in Biological Sciences and Computer Science and Engineering in SNU.

My research interests are mainly on multimodal 3D computer vision, and social AI. I like to play around to see how various modes of communications such as voices or texts can help create vision algorithms that's more realistic and acts in a more human-like manner.
